    <p>Self-taught artist David Goslin began painting in 1980, inspired by the work of Morris Louis, Gene Davis, and other members of the Washington color school. The central intellectual and emotional challenge in all of his paintings is the interplay of different colors. His primary goal is to create beautiful works in the color school tradition.</p>

    <p>Goslin’s work to date comprises more than 155 paintings, mostly acrylic on natural and primed canvas. His work has been exhibited in the main gallery of the National Academy of Sciences and recently in the Mykolas Zilinskas Gallery of the M.K. Curilionis National Art Museum in Kaunas Lithuania. His paintings are in numerous private collections, as well as the Pew Charitable Trusts, National Academy of Sciences and American Collection of the M.K. Curilionis National Art Museum.</p>

    <p>He was one of the six artists whose work was impounded by the Serbian government on its way to an exhibition in Bucharest, Romania in November, 2011. The artwork was released in June, 2012 in time for an exhibition in Paris.</p>

    <p>A sociologist by training, Goslin holds PhD and MA degrees from Yale University and a BA degree from Swarthmore College. He retired from his most recent full-time position as President and CEO of the American Institutes for Research in 2001 to devote more time to writing and his art. He is the author of six books, including Engaging Minds: Motivation and Learning in America’s Schools. He moved with his wife from Falls Church, Virginia to the Landings on Skidaway Island, Savannah, Georgia in December, 2016.</p>
